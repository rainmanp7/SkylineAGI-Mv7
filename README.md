Skyline Artificial General intelligence. AGI Machine Learning Model

Convert from CSV to one single sqlite3
the reason is from testing I incountered situations 
where the csv file required to be to specific and would
have coding issues about it's configuration or any configuration.
to get prototype working and finish the internals.
i need a really easy way to get the information in such a way
that's not easy to mess up for any reason.
So we must use a simple structure format already
supported by python and other programing languages.

The corrected working validated files.
