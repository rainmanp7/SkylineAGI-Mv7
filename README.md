# SkylineAGI MV7  

**Skyline Artificial General Intelligence**  
Version: MV7  

## Overview  
SkylineAGI MV7 is a validated and modular implementation of Artificial General Intelligence concepts. This release marks a significant improvement over the previous version (SkylineAGI6) by transitioning from a CSV-based database to a SQLite database for improved performance, testing, and scalability.  

Each file now contains standalone **test code** to ensure the **logic and operations** function independently. All validated files produce no errors or warnings and are confirmed to perform as intended.  

## Key Improvements  
1. **Database Transition**:  
   - Migrated from CSV to **SQLite** for enhanced data integrity and smoother operations.  
2. **File Validation**:  
   - Modules are categorized into:  
     - **Validated Working Files**: Tested and confirmed error-free.  
     - **Unvalidated Changing Files**: Actively under development and testing.  
3. **Code Modularity**:  
   - Improved code organization, facilitating easier debugging and extension.  

## File Status  

### Validated Working Files  
The following files have been tested, validated, and confirmed to be error-free:  

- `logging_config.py`  
- `uncertainty_quantification.py`  
- `internal_process_monitor.py`  
- `parallel_utils.py`  
- `complexity.py`  
- `memory_manager.py`  
- `parallel_bayesian_optimization.py`  
- `cache_utils.py`  
- `config.json`  
- `agi_config.py`  
- `metacognitive_manager.py`  

### Unvalidated Changing Files  
The following files are under active development and testing:  

- `[cross_domain_generalization].py`
- `[cross_domain_generalization].py`
- `[assimilation_memory_module].py`
- `[cross_domain_evaluation].py`
- `[main].py`

> *Note: Unvalidated files may contain errors, warnings, or incomplete implementations. These will be updated progressively.*  

## Installation and Usage  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/rainmanp7/SkylineAGI-Mv7.git  
   cd SkylineAGI-Mv7  
   ```  

2. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

3. Run individual validated modules for verification:  


3. For unvalidated files, run cautiously for testing only.  


## Comparison with Previous Versions  
- **SkylineAGI6**:  
   - Relied on CSV-based data storage.  
   - Lacked standalone test validations.  
   - Contained unverified modules with known limitations.  
- **SkylineAGI MV7**:  
   - Transitioned to **SQLite**.  
   - Fully validated working files with clear categorization.  
   - Improved operational testing and standalone executions.  

## Future Plans  
- Finalize all unvalidated files into the validated category.  
- Implement MySQL database integration for enhanced scalability to convert to skyla
- Expand testing automation with CI/CD pipelines.  
- Enhance module interconnections for AGI workflows.
